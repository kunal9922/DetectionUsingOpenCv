# DetectionUsingOpenCv
In this repo we will create a python program that can detect the hand.

#### ## hand detection

The ability to perceive the shape and motion of hands can be a vital component in improving the user experience across a variety of technological domains and platforms. For example, it can form the basis for sign language understanding and hand gesture control, and can also enable the overlay of digital content and information on top of the physical world in augmented reality.

## Compute hand and assign some key point for detected landmarks on hand.
